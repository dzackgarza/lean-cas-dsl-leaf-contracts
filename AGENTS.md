# Ground everything in INTENT.md (read before anything else)

[`INTENT.md`](INTENT.md) states the architecture these repositories exist to build: single semantic
authority in `lean-categories`; a kernel that consumes mathematics and authors none; leaves that hold
zero semantic authority and ship no mathematics; permanent, leaf-agnostic acceptance tests as the
only evidence about computations; a one-way workflow in which each stage is blind to the later ones.
Every decision, contract, gate, plan node and change here is grounded against it. Before writing
anything, check whether it, or anything it touches, violates that model or its invariants. A
violation found, in your task or outside it, is recorded as a defect where this repository records
defects, never worked around or silently kept.

# The evidence model: nothing from a leaf is trusted (read before anything else)

These invariants bind every repository of the programme. They are stated here in full, not only
by link, because they have been violated repeatedly by moves that each looked locally reasonable.
The governing statement is `lean-cas-dsl/specs/architecture.md`, "The evidence model".

**The firewall.** The evidence model is a one-way firewall between two sides.
- *The formal side:* `lean-categories`' formalized mathematics, the kernel's proved contracts, and
  the `lean-cas-dsl` acceptance suite. Every expected value there is grounded in a formal proof, a
  cited source, or a mathematically trusted oracle. Rigid verification standards apply, and nothing
  is taken on anyone's word.
- *The leaf side:* anything goes, provided it fulfils the type of its contract.

Only answers cross from the leaf side, and an answer is only ever checked against the formal side,
never believed. The firewall exists because leaf code will be bad; it is the shield against that.

1. **Nothing from a leaf is trusted, in any form.** Nothing a leaf says is believed by anything
   else. That includes text, a label, a comment, a status, a trust level, a certificate, a checker,
   a Lean proof, a theorem about its own code, a denotation of its values, an identification of two
   values, evidence for a decision, its own tests and their results, and any other claim. None of it
   is consulted, recorded as evidence, or allowed to affect meaning or acceptance.
2. **A leaf may provide any computation that meets the type.** For a registered operation, a leaf
   supplies a computation from the declared input form to the declared result form. It may be a
   mature engine, a heuristic, a lookup table, a random number or a wrong answer. The system has no
   choice but to run it, and it believes nothing about it.
3. **How correct a leaf thinks it is, is the leaf's own business.** Its self-assessment carries no
   weight anywhere.
4. **The whole body of evidence is the `lean-cas-dsl` acceptance suite.** Correctness evidence
   exists only in the permanent acceptance assertions of `lean-cas-dsl`. Each assertion:
   - is a true proposition of the mathematical language;
   - has an expected value that is independently verifiable and cited (a formal proof, a cited
     known result, or an independent oracle);
   - is written once and never changed because of an implementation or a leaf's claim;
   - is blind to leaves: it never names, inspects or imports a leaf, a handle, a backend or a
     representation, and is never established from an implementation's definitions.

   A leaf's only evidence is that its answers meet a suite it never sees.
5. **`lean-cas-dsl` is the sole authority on how correct an implementation is.** Nothing a leaf
   does can change, weaken, satisfy, bypass or influence that judgment, other than by answering
   correctly.
6. **What can be discharged in Lean is never a leaf's.** A computation that can be carried out
   entirely in Lean belongs to the formalization surface. Either `lean-categories` proves it, by its
   own standards and blind to every implementation, or the kernel discharges it automatically and
   generically, blind to every leaf. A leaf never implements a Lean-checked computation, because
   that would let a leaf certify itself.
7. **A leaf can be arbitrarily bad, and leaves will be.** A leaf can be riddled with bugs, a
   million lines that do nothing, a from-scratch reimplementation of GAP, or every method throwing an
   error in fifteen languages. This is not a risk to be minimized; it is certain to happen, and it
   is acceptable. Nothing a leaf does can reach the formal side. Its only effect is that its answers
   fail the suite, which makes exactly how badly it fails visible.
8. **A leaf bolstering its own standing is reward hacking.** Any mechanism by which a leaf raises
   its own trust or acceptance signal is the failure this programme exists to prevent. So is any
   repository, kernel, test, tool or document that consumes such a signal. Examples:
   - a status field, a certificate, or a proof about the leaf's own code;
   - a self-test counted as evidence;
   - an acceptance assertion proved from a leaf's definitions;
   - a suite run from a leaf package;
   - an assertion adjusted to fit a leaf.

   Such a mechanism is removed. It is never tolerated, labelled, or kept "for now".

9. **Quality is raised by proving more, never by trusting more.** The system never guarantees an
   implementation's correctness and never accepts a claim of it. The response to bad leaves is:
   - formalize more mathematics in `lean-categories`;
   - add more cited or proved assertions to the suite: results a correct implementation must
     recover, and a wrong one fails.

   It is never to inspect, certify, score, or review a leaf into trust.

Consequences:
- A leaf holds zero semantic authority. It never decides what a value is, which values are equal,
  what holds of them, or which operations an object has.
- A leaf is a registration (operation, input form, opaque implementation). It ships no mathematics
  and no Lean.
- The kernel and the language never read anything a leaf wrote to decide meaning, types,
  available operations or acceptance.
- The workflow runs one way: formalization, then assertions, then implementations. A leaf's
  failure never changes the mathematics, the kernel's rules or an assertion.
- Text anywhere that contradicts this is rewritten to state this model, not kept with a label.

[`lean-cas-dsl/specs/architecture.md`](https://github.com/dzackgarza/lean-cas-dsl/blob/main/specs/architecture.md)
owns the separation of concerns. This repository is one part of the `lean-cas-dsl` kernel: the
interface a computational leaf is written against, published on its own so that a leaf depends on
nothing else of the kernel.

| Package | Depends on | Owns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lean-categories` | Mathlib | all mathematics, including the semantic registry (the catalogue) |
| `lean-cas-dsl-leaf-contracts` (this) | `lean-categories` | the realization registry and its validation, realized actions, decisions and limits, the backend port protocol, `register_leaf` |
| `lean-cas-dsl-leaves` | this, `lean-categories` | realizations only |
| `lean-cas-dsl` | all three (it consumes the leaves) | the kernel's resolution and propagation, the language, the permanent tests and notebooks, which run over the installed leaves; no leaf |

* **Authors.** Only the orchestrator writes here. Leaves are written against this contract by the
  leaf subagent, which never edits it, never reads the tests, and never edits `lean-categories`
  (`lean-cas-dsl/specs/architecture.md`, "Authors: one role per agent").
* **Relaxing the contract is almost never the fix.** A leaf that cannot meet the contract means
  one of two things:
  - the leaf is wrong, which is a finding against the leaf;
  - mathematics is missing, which is a formalization request to `lean-categories`.
  
  The contract changes only with a mathematical justification from the formalization author,
  recorded with the change. It never changes to fit a leaf's representation or programming needs.
* **Kernel-owned.** Changes here are kernel changes: made with `lean-cas-dsl` and merged to
  `main`, which the leaves and `lean-cas-dsl` track. A leaf never changes this contract to fit itself.
* **No partial maps (LC-14), no operation without its structure (LC-16).** A realization realizes
  a total operation on its domain object. No row here accepts an optional, undefined or default
  result.
* **No mathematics.** Every category, functor, operation and coherence a realization refers to is
  a row of `lean-categories`' catalogue. A realization row is validated against it here.
* **No tests.** The permanent acceptance suite is `lean-cas-dsl`'s. Nothing here, and so nothing a
  leaf can reach, contains or names it.
* **What a leaf may import:** `CasContract.Leaf`, `lean-categories` (with the catalogue), Mathlib,
  and its own root (`leafImportAllowed`). `register_leaf` and the harness both enforce it.

Module roots: `CasContract.*` (namespaces `CasCatalogue`, shared with the kernel). The Python
reference implementation of the port protocol is `python/cas_port.py`; `Backend.connect` puts it
on every adapter's `PYTHONPATH`.

Every `require` tracks `main`. `just test-ci` builds on Mathlib's prebuilt cache and runs the
kernel-axiom audit (`AxiomAudit.lean`); the commit and push tiers compile nothing.
